# hotel-site
ReactJS, used different components. Features include ability to chat with a Hotel Agent, make reservations, and a login feature so users can save their ideas for hotels, travel locations, etc. Offering only about a thousand hotels in a certain area since adding more would mean more research/time to get their information. Uses prexisting location/GPS APIs to look at a map with descriptions of nearby hotels in a specific area that spans about 50 miles
